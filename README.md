# STM32F3-Discovery-Board-Embedded-Systems-Projects
This repository hosts a collection of projects developed for the STM32F3 Discovery board, focusing on microprocessor programming and embedded systems development.

# Requirements
- STM32F3 Discovery Board
- GDB (GNU Debugger): Install GDB for debugging and flashing code onto the STM32F3 board
- Connect the STM32F3 Discovery board to your Linux machine via USB for flashing and debugging

# Running with GDB
  - Clone the repo
  - Compile the project using "make"
  - Use minicom of the board to flash lights
  - You can also use the gyroscope on the board to play with the lights using minicom
